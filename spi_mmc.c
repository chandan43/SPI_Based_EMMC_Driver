/*It is sometimes necessary, however, to allow the processor to access a 
  mapped streaming DMA buffer. To that end, the DMA layer has long provided 
  a set of functions (like dma_sync_single() and pci_sync_single()) which 
  transfer ownership of the buffer to the CPU. What has always been lacking, 
  however, is a way to transfer ownership back to the device. To fill in that gap, 
  the various synchronization functions have been split in two; instead of 
   dma_sync_single() a driver must now call one or both of:

    dma_sync_single_for_cpu(struct device *dev, 
                            dma_addr_t dma_handle, 
			    size_t size,
			    enum dma_data_direction direction);

    dma_sync_single_for_device(struct device *dev, 
                               dma_addr_t dma_handle, 
			       size_t size,
			       enum dma_data_direction direction);

 dma_sync_single_for_cpu() gives ownership of the DMA buffer back to the processor. 
 After that call, driver code can read or modify the buffer, but the device should 
 not touch it. A call to dma_sync_single_for_device() is required to allow the device 
 to access the buffer again. The other synchronization functions 
  (for scatter/gather and DAC mappings) have been changed as well.

 As might be expected from a change like this, the result was a lot of broken drivers. 
 The patch fixes the in-tree users of the discontinued DMA functions. Out-of-tree and 
 binary-only drivers, however, will have to be fixed separately.
